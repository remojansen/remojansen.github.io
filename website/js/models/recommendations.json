				"Remo reported directly to me but had to carry out the work to suit our teams in Ireland, UK, Netherlands, Macedonia, USA, Australia and South Africa. This meant that he was working on a global website and local websites within the global website structure. It was a very challenging task and one that was badly needed by Lucca Leadership.",
				"I found Remo to be professional and diligent in his work. He was always committed to his work plan and the organization and went above and beyond his role to help out when needed. Remo is a hard worker and was able to bring new ideas and ways of working to our organization. He has very good technical abilities and when he did not know how to do something he would research the solution himself."

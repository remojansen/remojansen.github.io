        <p>
            This book is a step-by-step guide that will get you started with TypeScript with the help of practical examples. You start off by understanding the basics and the new features of TypeScript 2.x. Next, you will learn to automate your development workflow with tools such as Grunt. Following this, you will be explained in detail about function, generics, and callbacks. Post this, object-oriented features and the memory management functionality of TypeScript are explained in detail. Going forward, you will be introduced to Functional Programming with TypeScript and will delve into Asynchronous programming principles. Finally, you will be introduced to the performance parameters and will learn to test your application.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the end of this book, you will have learned enough to implement all the concepts with the latest features of TypeScript to build a single page application from scratch.

                        WOW! I picked this book up using my Packt subscription and
                        can't put it down. The material flows and is easy to follow
                        along with, I never used Typescript before but found it
                        EXTREMELY USEFUL in web application development.

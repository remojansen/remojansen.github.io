With just over 4,000 awardees worldwide, Microsoft MVPs represent a highly select group of experts. MVPs share
a deep commitment to community and a willingness to help others. They represent the diversity of today’s
technical communities. MVPs are present in over 90 countries, in more than 40 languages, and across numerous
Microsoft technologies. MVPs share a passion for technology, a willingness to help others, and a commitment to
community. These are the qualities that make MVPs exceptional community leaders. MVPs’ efforts enhance
people’s lives and contribute to our industry’s success in many ways. By sharing their knowledge and experiences,
and providing objective feedback, they help people solve problems and discover new capabilities every day. MVPs
are technology’s best and brightest, and we are honored to welcome Remo as one of them.
To recognize the contributions they make, MVPs from around the world have the opportunity to meet Microsoft
executives, network with peers, and position themselves as technical community leaders. This is accomplished
through speaking engagements, one on one customer event participation and technical content development.
MVPs also receive early access to technology through a variety of programs offered by Microsoft, which keeps
them on the cutting edge of the software and hardware industry.

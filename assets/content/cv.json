		"Hola! I'm Remo H. Jansen, a Spanish full-stack cloud & web engineer living in Ireland since 2010.",
		"I work as a Technical Lead at Marsh McLennan. In this role, I lead a cross-functional team responsible for all technical aspects of application lifecycle management—from design and development through deployment, maintenance, and optimization. My focus is on building and supporting AI-powered applications that enhance business efficiency, streamline processes, unlock data-driven insights, and deliver greater value to clients and colleagues alike. Previously, I held technical roles such as Solution Engineer and Technical Lead at organizations including Microsoft, Aerlytix, Aon, and others. For over 15 years, I’ve immersed myself in open-source web technologies, particularly Node.js and TypeScript.",
		"I'm a developer at heart with a deep love for JavaScript, TypeScript, and building tools that make other developers more productive. Over the years, I've worked across startups, enterprise teams, and cloud platforms—always with a focus on creating intuitive, high-performance web applications. Whether it's visualizing financial data, optimizing developer workflows, or contributing to open-source, I bring a hands-on mindset and I care deeply about developer experience.",
		"I love being part of the tech community. I am a former Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP), the creator of InversifyJS, a lightweight IoC container for JavaScript apps with over 250 million downloads on npm, a former organizer of JSDayIE (Ireland's first JavaScript conference) and the Dublin TypeScript Meetup, as well as the author of TypeScript books and a content creator on DEV.to.",
		"I'm currently interested in learning more about the latest Azure services, multi-tenant SaaS architectures, digital experience platforms (DXP), Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime), and sustainable high performance in digital product teams.",
		"Outside of tech, I enjoy endurance sports such as triathlons and marathons: I'm an Ironman 140.6 finisher and currently working towards becoming an Abbott World Marathon Majors Six Star finisher."
